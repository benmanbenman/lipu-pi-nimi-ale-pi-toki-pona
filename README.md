# ni li seme?

this is a toki pona dictionary where you can search in either toki pona or english.

# mi ken pali pona e seme ?

currently the definitions of words are hopefully accurate (they are all taken from pu), but please change them if you think they have more meanings than i mentioned. i haven't included the words from the new dictionary because i don't have it, but if you do then it would be helpful if you added them to the words list in `App.svelte`. also if you feel any toki pona i used in this project is inaccurate then please correct it.

# mi kepeken e ni nasin seme?

to use the dictionary, download the repository and `cd` into it using the terminal. if you don't have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) then install it. then run the commands `npm init` and `npm run dev`. if you navigate to <http://localhost:5000> in your browser you should now be able to use the dictionary. i will try to get a website running soon but right now you have to run it manually.
